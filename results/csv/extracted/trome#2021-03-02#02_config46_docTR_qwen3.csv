"Wait, the user's message is empty except for the image. Since I can't access the image, I can't extract the data. Therefore, the correct response would be to output the header row only. But the user's example shows two data rows. Maybe the user expects me to generate a sample? But the instructions say to extract from the image. Since there's no image, perhaps the answer is just the header. But the user might have intended to provide an image and forgot. In that case, I should respond with the header and maybe note the absence of the image. However, the rules state to strictly output the CSV without explanations. So perhaps the correct answer is just the header row. Let me check the rules again. The first row must be the CSV header. So the answer should start with ""headline";"subheadline";"author";"content"" followed by the data rows. Since there's no image, there are no data rows. Therefore, the output is just the header. But the user's example shows two data rows. Maybe the user expects a sample. However, the user's instruction says to extract from the image. Since there's no image, I can't provide data rows. Therefore, the correct output is the header row only.";"trome";"2021-03-02";"2"
