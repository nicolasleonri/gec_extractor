"Trending Topics on Twitter";"NA";"NA";"These were some of the topics that were most talked about yesterday on Twitter. #CocaCola The American company Coca-Cola announced yesterday that it will stop using plastic straws in its cans sold in Western Europe starting next year. Instead, it will use cardboard with forest certification to meet its sustainability goals. Straws have been a symbol of ocean pollution for years. 'Coca-Cola is synonymous with plastic coins all over the world,' tweeted @ledesmagarin yesterday. #Facebook The social network was fined yesterday with more than $280,000 by Turkey's Data Protection Authority. The reason: Facebook violated the private data of thousands of Turkish users, exposing their name, gender, date of birth, marital status, and geographical location. 'It would be a shame if we didn't fix a system that allows big companies like #Facebook to engage in illegal practices, such as trampling on consumers' privacy rights,' wrote @AlberCastedo10. #Glacier Chile's General Water Directorate reported yesterday that the glaciers of Chile have experienced an 8% reduction in their mass since 2014 due to global warming. This represents the disappearance of almost 2,000 square kilometers of glacial surface. 'According to the UN, a billion people will be affected by 2050 due to the disappearance of glaciers,' tweeted @aggregatte.";"publimetro";"2019-10-04";"8"
"State of Exception Declared in Ecuador";"NA";"NA";"Chaos on the streets of all cities. The increase in gasoline prices has paralyzed the country. In an attempt to curb protests, the government of Ecuador declared a state of exception yesterday, which will be in effect for 60 days. This measure comes after President Lenin Moreno announced last Tuesday a series of economic measures due to fiscal savings needs. Among them was the elimination of fuel subsidies, implying an increase in fuel prices. In this way, it is intended to raise state revenues and save around $1.4 billion to pay off the debt that the country has with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This led transporters and university students to protest on the streets of Quito. Classes were suspended and buses and taxis stopped circulating. The protest grew and spread to other cities, reaching violent levels. The measure imposed by the Executive allows restricting certain rights, such as citizens' freedom of movement and prior censorship of media outlets. According to Minister of Government Mar√≠a Paula Romo, there are 19 detainees so far. There is no precise figure on the number of injured in clashes with the Police. Moreno's government has argued that these measures are necessary to lift the country's dollarized economy.";"publimetro";"2019-10-04";"8"
"Brexit Agreement Unconvincing for Brussels";"NA";"NA";"The European Parliament committee responsible for Brexit stated yesterday that the proposal presented by Prime Minister Boris Johnson does not constitute a 'basis for an agreement' to execute the UK's exit from the bloc. Committee members question that real issues have not been addressed if the Irish safeguard is removed. This point has always been the main obstacle for London's divorce with Brussels. The conservative leader proposes no border controls between Northern Ireland (part of the UK) and Ireland (EU member). He also suggests physical checks be conducted in commercial premises. However, European parliamentarians argue that the measure presents certain gaps that need to be resolved.";"publimetro";"2019-10-04";"8"
