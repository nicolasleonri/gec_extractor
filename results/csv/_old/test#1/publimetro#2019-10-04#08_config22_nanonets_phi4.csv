"Trending Topics on Twitter";"NA";"NA";"These were some of the topics that were most talked about yesterday on Twitter. #CocaCola The American company Coca-Cola announced yesterday that it will stop using plastic rings in its cans sold in Western Europe starting next year. Instead, it will use cardboard with forest certification to meet its sustainability goals. Plastic rings have been a symbol of ocean pollution for years. 'CocaCola equals mountains of plastic all over the world,' said the account @ledesmagarin yesterday. #Facebook The social network was fined more than $280,000 yesterday by Turkey's Data Protection Authority. The reason: Facebook violated the private data of thousands of Turkish users by exposing their name, gender, date of birth, marital status, and geographical location. 'It would be a shame if we don't fix a system that allows big companies like #Facebook to engage in illegal practices, such as trampling on consumers' privacy rights,' wrote @AlberCastedo10. #Glaciers Chile's General Water Directorate reported yesterday that the glaciers of Chile have experienced an 8% reduction in their mass since 2014 due to global warming. This represents the disappearance of almost 2,000 square kilometers of glacial surface. 'According to the UN, a billion people will be affected by 2050 due to the disappearance of glaciers,' wrote @aggregatte on Twitter.";"publimetro";"2019-10-04";"8"
"State of Exception Declared in Ecuador";"NA";"NA";"Chaos on the streets of all cities. The increase in gasoline prices has paralyzed the country. In an attempt to curb protests, the government of Ecuador declared a state of exception yesterday, which will be in effect for 60 days. This measure comes after President Lenín Moreno announced last Tuesday a series of economic measures due to fiscal savings needs. Among them was the elimination of subsidies for gasoline, implying an increase in fuel prices. In this way, it is intended to raise State revenues and save around $1.4 billion to pay off the debt that the country has with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). New Prices After implementing the new measures, the price of a gallon of gasoline rose from $1.85 to $2.40, while diesel went from $1.03 to $2.30. Labor unions have warned of indefinite protests until this increase is reversed or there are compensations. According to the Minister of Government, María Paula Romo, there are 19 detainees so far. There is no precise figure on the number of injured in clashes with the Police. The Moreno government has argued that these measures are necessary to lift the country's dollarized economy.";"publimetro";"2019-10-04";"8"
"Brexit Agreement Unconvincing for Brussels";"NA";"NA";"The European Parliament committee responsible for Brexit stated yesterday that the proposal presented by Prime Minister Boris Johnson does not constitute a 'basis for an agreement' to execute Britain's exit from the bloc. Committee members question that real issues have not been addressed if the Irish safeguard is removed. This point has always been the main obstacle to London's divorce with Brussels. The conservative leader proposes no border controls between Northern Ireland (part of the UK) and Ireland (an EU member). He also suggests physical checks be conducted in commercial premises. However, European parliamentarians argue that the measure presents certain gaps that need to be resolved.";"publimetro";"2019-10-04";"8"
