"Crimes of Agents from the Division of Homicide Investigations";"NA";"NA";"Cristhian Zamudio reports on the crime involving agents from the Division of Homicide Investigations at the Magdalena del Mar State Prosecutor's Office. Although yesterday a technical inspection confirmed the case of four soldiers who drowned in Marbella Beach, the objective was to verify the strength of the sea and wave height. A Salvadoran mentioned that today it reached a density of 1.5, whereas last Friday it was at 2, meaning stronger. During the inspection, agents also found property ownership on the beach and its residents present. 'We couldn't go further; without ropes, we would have been dragged away,' stated a witness. After thirty minutes, prosecutor José Oliva concluded the inspection, while an accompanying magistrate initially suggested that the procedure was insufficient, as preliminarily indicated by Salvage personnel. Natali Reina, the deputy provincial prosecutor of the case, noted that 'the procedures were conducted satisfactorily.' The lawyer for Edmundo Jiménez (80), one of the soldiers who died at Costa Verde Beach, attended the proceedings. Judge Walter Jiménez rejected a reconstruction plan and with Major El Ríos and the victim's brother's attorney present, prohibited Magdalena del Mar's lawyer Francisco Almaraz from leaving Marbella Bay on both past and this Friday, June 2nd.";"ojo";"2017-06-07";"11"
