"Formatting-wise, the output needs to be a CSV with specific headers: ""headline""";"subheadline";"author";"content. Each field must be enclosed in double quotes, and semicolons are used as separators. Importantly, if any field contains a semicolon, it should be replaced with a comma to maintain the integrity of the CSV structure.";"trome";"2020-03-13";"4"
