"Okay, let's see. The user wants me to extract information from an image of an article. But wait, there's no image provided here. Hmm, the user might have forgotten to include it. The instructions say to focus on articles with meaningful journalistic content and exclude short notices. Since there's no image, I can't extract any data. I need to make sure I follow the rules strictly. The output should be a CSV with the specified fields. If there's no image, the only possible response is to return the header with no data rows. Let me check the rules again. The first row must be the header, and each subsequent row is an article. Since there's no image, there's nothing to extract. So the correct response is just the header. I should output ""headline""";"subheadline";"author";"content and that's it. No other rows. Let me confirm that. Yes, that's right. The user might have made a mistake, but I have to follow the instructions as given. Alright, time to format the CSV correctly.";"trome";"2021-03-02";"2"
